# Introduction to NoSQL

## What is NoSQL?

NoSQL is a non-relational database that stores data in a format other than the traditional relational tables. NoSQL databases are designed to handle large amounts of data and provide high performance, high availability, and automatic scaling. NoSQL databases are also known as "not only SQL" or "non-SQL" databases.

## Why NoSQL?

NoSQL databases are designed to handle large amounts of data and provide high performance, high availability, and automatic scaling. NoSQL databases are also known as "not only SQL" or "non-SQL" databases.

## What are the types of NoSQL?

There are many types of NoSQL databases, but the most common are:

* Key-value stores
* Document stores
* Wide-column stores
* Graph databases

## What is a key-value store?

A key-value store is a database that stores data as key-value pairs. The key is used to retrieve the value. The key-value store is the simplest type of NoSQL database. It is also the most common type of NoSQL database. Key-value stores are often used to store configuration data, such as the URL of a database server.

## What is a document store?

A document store is a database that stores data in documents. A document is a data structure composed of field and value pairs. Documents are similar to JSON objects. Document stores are often used to store unstructured data, such as text documents.

## What is a wide-column store?

A wide-column store is a database that stores data in tables. A table is a collection of rows. Each row is a collection of columns. Each column has a name and a value. Wide-column stores are often used to store large amounts of data, such as sensor data.

## What is a graph database?

A graph database is a database that stores data in a graph structure. A graph is a collection of nodes and edges. Nodes are entities, such as people, places, and things. Edges are relationships between nodes. Graph databases are often used to store data that has a complex relationship, such as social networks.
